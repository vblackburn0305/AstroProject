Welcome to my astronomy project.

The purpose of this project is to parse prepared data in a csv file to perform data visulization techniques, data analysis, and a machine learning algorithm to attempt to classify the stars. The machine learning algorithm is implemented through the Scikit-learn library, which is an neural network.
